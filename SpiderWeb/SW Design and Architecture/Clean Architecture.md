## Why
decisions early, hard to change, center around framwork, 
# vs Clean Code

| **Aspect**              | **Clean Code**                                                                                             | **Clean Architecture**                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**               | code                                                                                                       | system                                                                                                                                    |
| **Scope**               | **Micro**-level (within functions, classes, or small components)                                           | **Macro**-level (across the entire system, including all layers)                                                                          |
| **Guiding Principles**  | Simplicity, clarity, consistency, meaningful names, small functions, Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) | Separation of concerns, dependency inversion, independence of frameworks, testability                                                     |
| **Primary Goal**        | readability, maintainability, ease of understanding                                                        | scalable, maintainable, adaptable                                                                                                         |
| **Impact**              | individual components                                                                                      | components interact, system level                                                                                                         |
| **Key Practices**       | - Use descriptive names  <br>- Keep functions/methods small  <br>- SRP  <br>- Write self-explanatory code  | - Separate layers (e.g., business logic, UI, data access)  <br>- Implement dependency inversion  <br>- Avoid tight coupling to frameworks |
| **Outcome**             | Cleaner, more maintainable codebases                                                                       | Well-organized, flexible, and robust system architecture                                                                                  |
| **Mutual Relationship** | Clean Code helps achieve clean architecture                                                                | Clean Architecture often requires clean coding practices                                                                                  |
