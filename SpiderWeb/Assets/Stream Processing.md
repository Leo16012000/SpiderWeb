| Feature/Aspect                    | [[In-memory Message Broker]]                            | [[Log-based Message Broker]]                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage**                       | Messages stored in RAM                                  | Messages stored in persistent log files on disk          |
| **Data Persistence**              | Mostly transient; data lost on failure unless backed up | Persistent; data survives restarts and failures          |
| **Performance**                   | High speed due to RAM usage                             | High throughput, optimized for disk I/O                  |
| **Scalability**                   | Can be challenging due to memory limits                 | Easier due to log replication and disk-based storage     |
| **Durability**                    | Lower; susceptible to data loss                         | High; designed for durability with logs                  |
| **Reliability**                   | Depends on additional persistence mechanisms            | High; inherent to design with recovery capabilities      |
| **Typical Use Cases**             | Real-time analytics, fast data interchange              | Event sourcing, high-volume logging, streaming analytics |
| **Data Handling Characteristics** | Suitable for non-critical, ephemeral data               | Suitable for critical, long-term data storage            |
| **Message Replayability**         | Not typically supported                                 | Supported; essential for recovery and consistency        |
| **Examples**                      | Redis Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ (in-memory mode)                | Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis                             |
