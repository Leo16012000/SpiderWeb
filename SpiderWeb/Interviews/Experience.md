# Tell me a little bit about yourself?
Leo, 3 years exp, work from June/21, before I've been the FE side, after an amount of time I mainly focus on backend side, exp around Java, Spring Boot and recently I learn Golang. I'm interested in technical analysis, system design, db design, performance optimization and currently I'm on the way to upgrade my skills.
